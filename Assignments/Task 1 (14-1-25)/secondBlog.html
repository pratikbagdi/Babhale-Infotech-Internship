            <h2>Ford Mustang GTD</h2>
            <p id="start">The Ford Mustang GTD, unveiled in 2025, represents a significant leap in automotive engineering, blending race-inspired technology with street-legal functionality. This limited-edition supercar is designed to deliver an exhilarating driving experience, both on the track and the open road.</p>
            <p>At the heart of the Mustang GTD lies a supercharged 5.2-liter V8 engine, meticulously engineered by Ford Performance. This powerhouse is tuned to produce over 800 horsepower, making it the most potent street-legal Mustang ever crafted by Ford. The engine is paired with an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, strategically mounted at the rear to achieve near-perfect 50/50 weight distribution. This configuration enhances handling and responsiveness, allowing drivers to fully exploit the car's capabilities. </p>
            <p>The Mustang GTD features a sophisticated suspension system, including a short-long arm front suspension that provides enhanced lateral stiffness and improved kinematics, especially during high-G cornering. This setup ensures exceptional stability and control, enabling the vehicle to tackle challenging road courses with confidence. Additionally, the car is equipped with a dry sump oil system, a first for a roadgoing Mustang, which maintains optimal oil pressure during aggressive driving maneuvers.</p>
            <p>Visually, the Mustang GTD is distinguished by its formed carbon fiber body panels and an aerodynamic rear wing, both contributing to significant weight reduction and increased downforce. The front fender vents serve a dual purpose: cooling the brakes and reducing lift and drag by releasing built-up air pressure from inside the wheel arches. These design elements not only enhance performance but also give the GTD a commanding presence on the road.</p>
            <p>Stopping power is provided by standard front six-piston Brembo™ anti-lock brakes, paired with substantial 325 mm front and 345 mm rear Michelin® Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. This combination ensures reliable braking performance and exceptional grip, essential for both high-speed track sessions and everyday driving.</p>
            <p>Ford has set ambitious performance targets for the Mustang GTD, aiming for it to complete a lap of Germany's Nürburgring circuit in under seven minutes. This goal underscores the car's track-focused design and engineering, positioning it among the elite ranks of high-performance vehicles capable of such feats.</p>
            <p>Reflecting its advanced technology and limited production, the Mustang GTD is priced starting at approximately $300,000. This pricing places it in direct competition with other high-end supercars, offering a unique blend of American muscle and cutting-edge performance.</p>
            <p>The Ford Mustang GTD stands as a testament to Ford's commitment to pushing the boundaries of performance and innovation. By integrating race-proven technologies into a street-legal vehicle, Ford has created a supercar that not only honors the Mustang's storied heritage but also sets new standards for the future of high-performance automobiles.</p>
