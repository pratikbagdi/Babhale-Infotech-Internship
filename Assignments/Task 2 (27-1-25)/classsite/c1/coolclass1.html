    <h1>Definition of Cool</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a firm believer in the fact that every single one of us thinks that we are in fact "cool". I think, err, know, that I am cool because of the clothes that I wear, my hair is cool, what I do is cool, how I do things, etc. Everything about me is sheer and utter coolness! I live cool and I breathe cool. I even bleed cool. I'll bet that I am way cooler than you. How do I know this? Well, because I am cool. Simple. Right!

    <p class="section-title">Calculate Cool</p>
    <p>
        5% aspiration + 95% self-perception + 10% public awareness + 46% individuality + 15% actions + 22% verbal + 99% what others think about you. Wait, this doesn't add to 100% - but I guess that is my point. Coolness doesn't add up to 100% either.

    <p class="coolness">Ultimate Coolness</p>

    <p>
        Being as cool as I am, I am going to go out on a limb ('cause that's what cool people do) and give you my hypothesis of ultimate coolness. Rest assured, the fact that I am stating my opinion makes me genuinely cool, but I digress momentarily. There is no real tangible coolness. Coolness is what you think it is. Being cool is how you perceive your world. It is all about your perception. Want to test your coolness (and my theory)? Just go ask someone if they think you are cool. They will look at you kind of funny, quickly think about potentially losing coolness by admitting to themselves that the person asking is, or could be cooler than the person being asked. And of course, you give an answer - BUT, probably indirectly, such as 'your socks or shirt is cool', or the purgatory of coolness - 'maybe', or 'depends'.
