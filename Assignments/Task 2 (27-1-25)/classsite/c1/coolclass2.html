    <p>
        Have you always wanted to be the cool guy, who always seems to do the right thing? Or are you dying to be the cool girl, who flows through life with ease and grace? If you think about all the people who you think of as cool, you'll find that they have several characteristics in common: they're all confident, unique, and on friendly terms with everyone. There's no reason you can't be like that yourself.

        We will always, on some level, be concerned with others' opinions of ourselves, but realize that ultimately, you will never be able to please everyone, so why bother trying? People have millions of ways to get under your skin. Learn to spot them and become immune. Be happy and have fun.

        Being cool doesn't mean being perfect, and being able to find humor in your moments of clumsiness and discomfort is the defining hallmark of being cool. People will not only respect you for it, but they'll like you for being human, just like them.
